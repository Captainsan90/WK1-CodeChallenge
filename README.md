SA.01: WK1: Code Challenge
08/09/2025
By Brian Sanare

Description
This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript coding challenges. Each challenge is presented as a standalone web page, complete and written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The three challenges included are:
a) Student Grade Generator: A web-based grade calculator that takes a user's numerical score (from 0 to 100) and displays the corresponding letter grade based on a predefined grading scale.

b) Speed Detector: A program that calculates a driver's demerit points. It checks if the car's speed is over the 70 km/s limit. For every 5 km/s above the limit, the driver gets one demerit point. If the total points exceed 12, their license is suspended.

c) Net Salary Calculator: A program that calculates an individual's net salary by taking their basic salary and benefits as input. It then calculates and subtracts mandatory Kenyan deductions, including PAYE (tax), NHIF, and NSSF, to determine the final take-home pay.
